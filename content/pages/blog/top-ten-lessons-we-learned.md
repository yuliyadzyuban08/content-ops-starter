  The Microclimate Discovery Environmental Walk, hosted by Yuliya Dzyuban,
  Melissa Ingaruca Moreno, and Kasturi Salvi during Pratt Climate Action Week in
  partnership with the Brooklyn Greenway initiative, aimed to focus on climate
  change's impact on both New York City's residents and ecosystems. This unique
  experience offered participants a chance to delve into the intricate world of
  urban microclimates, uncovering the hidden environmental dynamics near Pratt's
  campus neighborhood.What set this walk apart was its innovative approach:
  assigning each participant a specific role, be it a young boy, an old lady, a
  construction worker, or even a butterfly, a tree, or a squirrel. These roles
  provided diverse perspectives on the effects of microclimates, from human
  heat-related challenges to the vulnerabilities faced by local wildlife due to
  climate change. As we journeyed through the neighborhood, discussions and
  observations deepened our understanding of how microclimates shape daily life
  and well-being.The interactive nature of the walk fostered empathy and
  encouraged participants to reflect on the interconnectedness between humans
  and nature. It also sparked a call to action, inspiring advocacy for climate
  resilience and equity in solutions. This transformative experience went beyond
  traditional environmental education, emphasizing the urgent need for
  collective action in tackling climate change.At the walk's conclusion, a
  reflective session prompted participants to consider the implications of
  microclimates and brainstorm potential city-level solutions. This marked the
  first step toward creating a heat-sensitive city, where urban design accounts
  for the complexities of microclimates and climate change.

        subtitle: Building Collective Stroy of North Brooklyn Heat Experience
        text: >
          NYC is rapidly warming due to compound effects of climate change and
          the urban heat island effect. Nevertheless, some neighborhoods within
          the city are hotter than others. Such differences are shaped by the
          variations in greenery and building layout across the city.
          Furthermore, communities impacted by structural racism are more
          vulnerable to the risks of extreme heat due to the lack of coping
          mechanisms

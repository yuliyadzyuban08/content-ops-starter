      In this class, we will explore the complex interactions
       between rising temperatures, urban infrastructure, and
       public health through the lens of environmental justice.
       We will examine global examples of city and local-level
       heat mitigation and adaptation policies, review current
       strategies in NYC, assess their effectiveness, and develop
       recommendations.
       The course goals include understanding the interactions
       between extreme heat, urban infrastructure, and public
       health; exploring heat vulnerability and its measurement;
       critically assessing global heat management examples; and
      practicing professional communication skills. By the end
       of this course, students will be able to discuss the social
       and environmental impacts of heat, describe the metrics
       of heat vulnerability, analyze case studies of global heat
       action plans and policies, and develop a heat management
       plan with verifiable metrics.

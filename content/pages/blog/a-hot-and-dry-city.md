  Designing cities for thermal comfort is an important priority in a warming and
  urbanizing world. As temperatures in cities continue to break extreme heat
  records, it is necessary to develop and test new approaches capable of
  tracking human thermal sensations influenced by microclimate conditions,
  complex urban geometries, and individual characteristics in dynamic settings.
  Thermal walks are a promising novel research method to address this gap.
  During a thermal walk in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, we examined relationships
  between the built environment, microclimate, and subjective thermal judgments
  across a downtown city neighborhood slated for redevelopment. Subjects
  equipped with GPS devices participated in a 1-hour walk on a hot sunny day and
  recorded their experience in a field guide. Microclimate measurements were
  simultaneously collected using the mobile human-biometeorological instrument â€¦

          The Microclimate Discovery Environmental Walk, hosted by Yuliya
          Dzyuban, Melissa Ingaruca Moreno, and Kasturi Salvi during Pratt
          Climate Action Week in partnership with the Brooklyn Greenway
          initiative, aimed to focus on climate change's impact on both New York
          City's residents and ecosystems. This unique experience offered
          participants a chance to delve into the intricate world of urban
          microclimates, uncovering the hidden environmental dynamics near
          Pratt's campus neighborhood.


          What set this walk apart was its innovative approach: assigning each
          participant a specific role, be it a young boy, an old lady, a
          construction worker, or even a butterfly, a tree, or a squirrel. These
          roles provided diverse perspectives on the effects of microclimates,
          from human heat-related challenges to the vulnerabilities faced by
          local wildlife due to climate change. As we journeyed through the
          neighborhood, discussions and observations deepened our understanding
          of how microclimates shape daily life and well-being.


          The interactive nature of the walk fostered empathy and encouraged
          participants to reflect on the interconnectedness between humans and
          nature. It also sparked a call to action, inspiring advocacy for
          climate resilience and equity in solutions. This transformative
          experience went beyond traditional environmental education,
          emphasizing the urgent need for collective action in tackling climate
          change.


          At the walk's conclusion, a reflective session prompted participants
          to consider the implications of microclimates and brainstorm potential
          city-level solutions. This marked the first step toward creating a
          heat-sensitive city, where urban design accounts for the complexities
          of microclimates and climate change.

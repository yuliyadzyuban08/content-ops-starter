    text: "Cities are rapidly warming due to climate change and urbanization, posing significant threats to health and thermal comfort through extreme heat events and urban overheating. Understanding the relationship between microclimate and urban form is essential for designing more livable environments. A This project-based class will explore the interplay between urban planning, design, microclimate, and\_human\_health. Students learn microclimate monitoring methods, basics of human energy balance, and techniques to estimate & visualize personal heat exposure and thermal comfort. The course includes conducting microclimate monitoring fieldwork with smart mobile sensors, analyzing and visualizing environmental data, and calculating thermal comfort indices to provide evidence-based recommendations for neighborhood\_improvements.\n"

      In this class, we will explore the complex interactions
       between rising temperatures, urban infrastructure, and
       public health through the lens of environmental justice.
       We will examine global examples of city and local-level
       heat mitigation and adaptation policies, review current
       strategies in NYC, assess their effectiveness, and develop
       recommendations.
       The course goals include understanding the interactions
       between extreme heat, urban infrastructure, and public
       health; exploring heat vulnerability and its measurement;
       critically assessing global heat management examples; and
      practicing professional communication skills. By the end
       of this course, students will be able to discuss the social
       and environmental impacts of heat, describe the metrics
       of heat vulnerability, analyze case studies of global heat
       action plans and policies, and develop a heat management
       plan with verifiable metrics.

    text: "The Green Infrastructure Studio aims to develop a design proposal using nature-based solutions to address both site-specific, and broader societal and ecological challenges.\n\nThrough interactive sessions with multidisciplinary speakers, discussions on selected readings, and site visits, students grasp the principles of site analysis, green infrastructure construction and maintenance, valuation of nature-based solutions, and environmental justice, enabling them to develop a comprehensive design\_proposal.\n"

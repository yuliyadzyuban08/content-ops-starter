        subtitle: Building Collective Stroy of North Brooklyn Heat Experience
        text: "\n\nNYC is rapidly warming due to compound effects of climate change and the urban heat island effect. Nevertheless, some neighborhoods within the city are hotter than others. Such differences are shaped by the variations in greenery and building layout across the city. Furthermore, communities impacted by structural racism are more vulnerable to the risks of extreme heat due to the lack of coping mechanisms. While air temperature is a sufficient indicator of indoor exposure, radiant heat is the most influential variable influencing outdoor exposure, thus conducting measurements that can capture radiant exposure, for example mean radiant temperature, is essential in understanding thermal comfort of pedestrians. Furthermore, a recent report, Community Heat and Air Mapping Project for Environmental Justice by the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance highlights the need for hyperlocal heat monitoring.\_\n\nUrban vegetation is essential for providing relief from heat. By engaging with the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance (NBK Parks) the project team will support NBK Parksâ€™ advocacy towards equitable access to quality green spaces for North Brooklyn residents. NBK Parks has a more than two-decade history of working with residents, the city and private supporters on improving the quality of green spaces in North Brooklyn. By conducting a series of thermal walks, the project will track the hyperlocal differences in microclimate and thermal perception, develop microclimate awareness, and support advocacy efforts for nature-based solutions implementation in the neighborhood.\n\nThe walk route will be developed together with NBK Parks to align with their current priorities. Neighborhood residents and NBK Parks supporters will be invited to participate in the walk via social media channels. The project will be led by an Assistant Professor Dr. Yuliya Dzyuban, who is an expert in pedestrian level heat exposure assessment, and Research Assistant Kasturi Sudesh Salvi, who will be supporting fieldwork activities and data mapping. The results of the project will be presented to the NBK Parks and North Brooklyn community-based organizations.\n\n\n\n\n"
